h53 is a family page dedicated to our cabin, blending a living guidebook with a place for guests to leave their stories. The front door of the app is a Clerk-powered login that lets family and friends authenticate with passkeys or social providers before they contribute to the shared space.

A guest book anchors the experience, giving visitors an easy way to record highlights from their stay while the cabin blog doubles as a structured information hub—packing lists, instructions, and seasonal tips all live in a single feed. Convex keeps those entries in sync, so the content evolves in real time as relatives add notes or update guidance.

Staying ready for mountain weather is part of the charm, so I pulled in Yr.no forecasts directly alongside the itinerary tools. The weather module refreshes automatically, making it simple to know when it’s time to prep the sauna or pivot to board games.

I also used the project as a playground for GitHub’s spec-kit, experimenting with new workflow automation around PR reviews and deployment previews. The UI leans on TailwindCSS utilities layered with shadcn/ui components, which keeps everything consistent without sacrificing the warmth and personality that a family cabin deserves.
