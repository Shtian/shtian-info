This is a quick PoC made with SvelteKit and Supabase, mainly to play and test sveltekit-superforms. The goal of the project was to enable quick knowledge sharing within teams and be able to collect it in a single place. The forms support pasting links and writing a quick description, which can be aided by OpenAI.
